# mathjax-braket – Dirac bra-ket and set no­ta­tions

MathJax Support for the LaTeX package "braket", a simple package generally used by physicists to typeset notation 
commonly seen in quantum mechanics. Additionally, set notation is also implemented.

Allows programmers to write quantum-mechanical equations without the overhead of additional or unnecessary macros

Pro­vides macros to type­set bra-ket no­ta­tion, as well as set spec­i­fiers, with a sin­gle (“|”) or a dou­ble (“||” or (“\|”) ver­ti­cal bar spec­i­fier in be­tween two brack­eted parts. Each macro comes in a fixed-size ver­sion and an ex­pand­ing ver­sion.
